<h2><font color=red>Warning</font></h2>

<p>
    In this assignment, you will create a server that executes commands on your machine. Obviously,
    this is dangerous. Your program should use the provided <tt>sprintf</tt> call to create
    the path and name of executables. Furthermore, you should use <tt>basename</tt> to
    extract only the last component of the executable name provided by the user. Finally,
    you should carefully consider what executables and links (if any) you place in the
    directory where job executables are stored. (You already have one executable in place for
    testing.)
</p>

<p>
    Please also make sure that your clients and servers are shut down when you are not actively
    using them, to avoid port conflicts. Also, since you are using <tt>fork</tt>
    in this assignment, verify <i>frequently</i> that you are not creating stray processes.
</p>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>
    Your job is to build both a client and a server that implement a <i>task management protocol</i>.
    The protocol allows a client to connect to a server to run jobs. The client can request that
    jobs be created or killed and receives the output of these jobs. Systems like these are used in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster">cluster environments</a>
    to allow users to manage tasks being run on the cluster. In reality, the
    client would connect to a front end which would distribute jobs to the cluster; in this assignment,
    you're creating the client and the server that would run on a single cluster computer (not the
    front-end that monitors the entire cluster and distributes jobs).
</p>

<p>
    You have been provided with starter code for the client (<tt>jobclient.c</tt>) and server
    (<tt>jobserver.c</tt>). Both of these files rely on structs and variables defined in <tt>jobprotocol.h</tt>
    (currently mostly empty) and can use helpers stored in <tt>jobprotocol.c</tt> (currently totally empty).
    Both also rely on
    <tt>socket.c</tt>, the socket helper that we provided for lab and used in lecture. You may
    modify any of the <tt>job*</tt> files, but please do not modify the <tt>socket.*</tt> files.
</p>

<p>
    You have also been provided with a <tt>Makefile</tt> that creates the <tt>jobclient</tt> and
    <tt>jobserver</tt> executables and also builds the jobs in the <tt>jobs</tt> directory. Please
    do not modify this <tt>Makefile</tt>. You may, however, add additional executables to the <tt>jobs</tt>
    directory and modify the <tt>Makefile</tt> in that directory to build the new executables, but
    <b>you should be very careful about what executables you add</b>. Anyone who connects to your
    server would be able to run them.
</p>

<p>
    As you review the requirements and read the starter code, you will see that the code you have
    written in lab will be very useful. You may use any code that you have written for a lab.
</p>

<p>
    You will also notice that we have provided very little guidance about how to implement the two
    required programs. That's by design. This assignment is a capstone for the course. It asks you
    to use dynamic memory, to check errors carefully, to <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt>, and to use
    <tt>pipe</tt>, <tt>dup2</tt>, and <tt>select</tt>. You're given significant freedom to build this
    program using the tools you have available. Show us what you've learned!
</p>

<h2> Requirements </h2>

<p>
    Your client and server must, jointly, implement the protocol described in this section. Note that
    we may use our own client with your server (and vice versa) during testing to verify that your
    code implements the protocol as defined. We will also test your client and server together.
</p>

<h3> The Protocol </h3>

<p>
    The protocol consists of network-newline terminated messages. Each message sent from the client to
    the server is a <i>command</i> to be executed by the server. Each message from the server to the
    client is an <i>output</i> to be displayed on the client's <tt>STDOUT</tt>. No single command or line
    of output can exceed <i>BUFSIZE</i> characters (defined in the .h file).
</p>

<p>
    The following <i>commands</i> are supported:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>jobs</b>: Upon receipt, the server should send a message to the client, "<tt>[SERVER] pid pid pid ...</tt>",
    where the PIDs of the currently running jobs are separated by spaces. The PIDs should be presented in
    the order in which they were created. If there are no currently running jobs, the message should
    read, "<tt>[SERVER] No currently running jobs</tt>".<br /><br />

    This will require that the server maintain a list of jobs. Info for each job should be stored in a struct.
    Since the number of executing jobs is bounded by <tt>MAXJOBS</tt>, you could use an array, but it might make
    sense to use a linked list instead.
    </li><br />

    <li><b>run <i>jobname</i> [<i>arg</i>]...</b>: Upon receipt, the server should attempt to execute the
    job named <i>jobname</i>, passing it the arguments (0 or more) provided. To protect against forkbombs, the
    server should keep a count of the jobs currently active; if creating another job would exceed <tt>MAXJOBS</tt>,
    then the server should not create the job. It should send the client the message, <tt>"[SERVER] MAXJOBS exceeded</tt>".<br /><br />

    If the job may be created, the client should automatically be
    set to <i>watch</i> (see below) the newly created job and should be sent the output, <tt>"[SERVER] Job %d
    created"</tt> where %d is the PID of the created job. If the job cannot actually be created (perhaps because
    of an <tt>exec</tt> error), then an appropriate message should be generated using <tt>perror</tt>
    (which will cause the error message to be sent to the client, since it is watching the job).<br /><br />

    This will require <tt>fork</tt>, <tt>exec</tt>, <tt>pipe</tt>, and <tt>dup2</tt>. (Please do not use
    <tt>popen</tt>, <tt>system</tt>, etc. to run the commands for you.)
    </li><br />

    <li><b>kill <i>pid</i></b>: Upon receipt, the server should attempt to send a kill signal to the job
    specified by <i>pid</i>. If <i>pid</i> doesn't refer to a currently executing job that was created by
    the server, the server should send the client the message, <tt>"[SERVER] Job %d not found"</tt>.
    </li><br />

    <li><b>watch <i>pid</i></b>: Upon receipt, the server should set the client to watch the specified job.
    If the <i>pid</i> doesn't refer to a currently executing job, the client should receive the same error
    message as is sent for <tt>kill</tt>. If the client is not yet watching the job, then the client should
    be added the set of watchers and the message, <tt>"[SERVER] Watching job %d"</tt> should be sent. If the
    client is already watching the job, then the client is removed from the set of watchers and the message,
    <tt>"[SERVER] No longer watching job %d"</tt> should be sent.
    </li><br />

    <li><b>exit</b>: This command is not transmitted to the server. It causes the client to exit with status code 0.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Both the client and server should be resilient to invalid commands. The client should reject invalid commands with
    the response "<tt>Command not found</tt>". If the server receives an invalid command (perhaps from a misbehaving client), it should respond with, "<tt>[SERVER] Invalid command: %s</tt>" where %s is the command the server received.
</p>

<h3>Other Properties</h3>

<p>
    <b>Network Newlines</b>: Both the client and server should replace network newlines in commands and output with
    the newlines appropriate for the system before displaying them.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Logging</b>: The server should maintain a log by displaying every command it receives, every response
    it sends (strings prefixed by "<tt>[SERVER]</tt>"), and all of the output received from jobs. Commands
    received from clients should be prefixed by "<tt>[CLIENT %d]</tt>" (and a space), where %d is the client's
    socket descriptor. Output received from jobs on their <tt>STDOUT</tt> should be prefixed by "<tt>[JOB %d]</tt>"
    (and a space), where %d is the job's PID.  Output received from jobs on their <tt>STDERR</tt> should be
    prefixed by "<tt>*(JOB %d)*</tt>" (yes, and a space).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Targeted Messages</b>: This should go without saying, but output should only be sent to the relevant
    clients. If client A sends a command, then only client A should get a response. (Client B shouldn't see
    the error or success message.) Only the clients watching a job should receive output from that job.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Watching</b>: A client that is <t>watching</t> a job should be sent any output that job generates. The
    output should be prefixed by "<tt>[JOB %d]</tt>" or <tt>*(JOB %d)*</tt>", just like the output generated on
    the server.<br /><br />

    This feature requires that the server track which clients are watching a specific job. The number of clients
    that could watch a job is not bounded, so this suggests a linked structure.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Buffering</b>: Both the client and server should buffer. The client should not display output until
    a full line is received and should send a single command at a time. The server should only send full
    lines of output, and it should wait to receive a full command before evaluating it and attempting to
    execute it. (Why do we have to buffer when both the client and server are sending full messages? Recall
    that the network itself may fragment the messages.)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Minimal Waiting</b>: This requirement is related to <i>buffering</i>. I/O needs to be handled with
    minimal waiting. The clients should receive output even while they're waiting for input from the user.
    The server should handle inputs from the jobs and clients as they are received; no <tt>read</tt> that
    it issues should block, and inputs shouldn't wait for a job to finish executing, for example..<br /><br />

    This requires careful use of <tt>select</tt>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Client Termination</b>: When a client exits, it should always try to close the
    socket to the server. The server, upon receiving a socket close, should clean up its data structures and then
    log the exit of the client with the message, "<tt>[CLIENT %d] Connection closed</tt>".<br /><br />

    The normal exit status of the client should be a 0. It should exit with a 1 (and emit an appropriate message
    with <tt>perror</tt>) if a system or library call fails (including when the server socket closes).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Job Termination</b>: Jobs are separate executables outside of the protocol, so we cannot put many requirements
    on them. However, the server should generate a message to all clients watching the job when a job exits. <b>Update (March 30)</b>: If the process exits, then the message should be, "<tt>[JOB %d] Exited with status %d</tt>." Otherwise (if the program exited due to a signal), the message should be, "<tt>[Job %d] Exited due to signal</tt>."
</p>

<p>
    <b>Server Termination</b>: When a server exits, it should always try to close all of the client sockets (first)
    and then terminate all running jobs (second).  The clients should be sent the message, "<tt>[SERVER] Shutting down</tt>".
</p>

<p>
    When might a server terminate? In most cases, errors should be handled without termination. If a client socket closes, for example, that doesn't mean that the <tt>read</tt> error it generates should terminate the server. If
    a library or system call error is unrecoverable, exit with status code 1 after cleaning up. The other way the
    server could terminate is if it receives <tt>SIGINT</tt> (Ctrl-C). In that case, the system should clean up
    and then exit with status code 0. (Any other signal should simply terminate the server; it may not clean up if
    it receives a SIGTERM, for example.)
